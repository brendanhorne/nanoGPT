### 304.01 DESCRIPTION

This section covers the requirements for the placement of gravel, sand, soft or ripped rock, crushed rock, crushed scoria or crushed concrete pavement materials, for the construction of unbound flexible pavement layers.

### 304.02 DEFINITIONS

**Unbound Flexible Pavement**

A pavement consisting of an unbound granular base and subbase materials, with a thin asphalt or sprayed bituminous seal surfacing.

**Pavement Course**

For the purpose of this specification, the pavement base, upper subbase and lower subbase shall each be termed a pavement course. A pavement course may comprise one or more layers.

**Base**

One or more layers of material usually constituting the uppermost structural element of a pavement on which the surfacing may be placed, which may be composed of crushed rock, or other materials as specified in Clause 304.03. Typically, base is the top 200 mm of the pavement or the pavement base thickness as specified or shown on the drawings.

**Subbase**

The pavement material constructed on the subgrade to the underside of the base either for the purpose of making up the additional pavement thickness required, or to provide a working platform. The subbase may be constructed of the same material type or may comprise two different material types as follows:

(a) Upper Subbase - the better quality material immediately below the base; and

(b) Lower Subbase - the lower quality material immediately above the subgrade.

If only a single layer of subbase is specified or shown on the drawings, the specified requirements for subbase material shall conform to the requirements of an upper subbase material.

**Subgrade**

Subgrade is the trimmed or prepared portion of the formation on which the pavement including shoulders is constructed.

**Segregated Area**

An area of a pavement layer, which does not comply with the grading requirements of Clause 304.10. Typically this is where the finer material is either not present or has settled to the bottom of the layer leaving the coarser materials at the surface.



### 304.03 MATERIALS

\*\*\* The Contractor shall be responsible for the procurement of sufficient specified material to complete the work. The Contractor shall supply details demonstrating compliance of the materials with Section 801 and the following sections as relevant: ##(strikethrough whichever is not relevant):

Section 811 Gravel, Sand and Soft or Ripped Rock for Pavement Base and Subbase

Section 812 Crushed Rock for Pavement Base and Subbase

Section 818 Crushed Scoria for Pavement Base and Subbase

Section 820 Crushed Concrete for Pavement Subbase and Light Duty Base.

Where a crushed product is specified in accordance with Sections 811, 812, 818 and 820, mixes registered by VicRoads as 'General' may be used in the construction of roadworks. Mixes registered as 'Conditional' may be used provided the conditions are complied with. Mixes registered as 'Experimental' shall only be used with the written permission of the Superintendent.

Water added to the pavement material shall be clean and substantially free from detrimental impurities such as oils, salts, acids, alkalis and vegetable substances. Water shall contain a maximum of 1000 mg/L of suspended solids. Water supplied from sources where dissolved salts are known or likely to be present shall be tested for electrical conductivity prior to use. The electrical conductivity shall not be more than 3500 µS/cm. Water sources classified by the relevant Water Authority as potable water shall be exempt from this requirement.

### 304.04 SUBGRADE PREPARATION

Prior to placing subbase material, the subgrade shall meet the requirements of Section 204.

### 304.05 DELIVERY DOCKETS

Where material is scheduled for measurement by loose volume in delivery vehicles or by mass, a delivery docket for each load shall be issued to the Superintendent at the point of delivery.

Where material is measured by other means and for Lump Sum Contracts, the Contractor shall make delivery dockets available for inspection on request by the Superintendent.

Delivery dockets shall show:

### 304.11 MINIMUM FREQUENCY OF TESTING

##### (a) General

The Contractor shall carry out compaction density testing and post-compaction grading and PI testing at a frequency sufficient to ensure that work performed under the Contract complies with the specified requirements but shall not be less than that shown in Table 304.111.

The minimum test frequency specified in Table 304.111 shall not apply to small areas as defined in Section 173. In this case, every lot shall be tested separately for compliance with the specified requirements.



If the nature of material in any lot being placed has visibly altered when compared to previous lots placed, the Superintendent may require additional testing to be undertaken to confirm that the lot complies with the specified requirements for post-compaction grading and PI. No additional payment will be made for this testing.

##### (b) Compaction

The Contractor shall initially test every lot for acceptance of compaction in accordance with the requirements of the Specification. Testing of every lot shall continue until three consecutive lots of like material and/or work have achieved the standards specified in Clauses 304.08 and 304.10 when tested for the first time. The Contractor may reduce the frequency of compaction testing to the minimum test frequency as specified in Table 304.111 after satisfying this requirement.

The Contractor may continue to test at the minimum frequency until such time as a lot fails to achieve the specified requirements. All subsequent lots shall be tested until three consecutive lots of like material and work have achieved the specified standard, at which time the frequency of testing may revert to the minimum test frequency.

If the Contractor is testing at the minimum frequency and any test lot does not meet specification requirements, the Superintendent may require any previous untested lots between the last lot to be tested and the failed lot to be tested. This testing shall be carried out at no additional cost to VicRoads.

##### (c) Post-compaction Grading and Plasticity Index (PI)

(i) Scale A Requirements for Post Compaction Grading and PI Testing

Where testing is specified in Clause 304.10(c) or (d) and Clause 304.12 requires it to be Scale A, all pavement layers shall be tested for post-compaction grading and PI at the frequency specified in Table 304.111.

The first lot of each pavement layer shall be tested for post-compaction grading and PI. If the lot satisfies the requirements specified in Clause 304.10(a) and (b) as applicable, the Contractor may test at the minimum frequency as specified in Table 304.111. The Contractor shall immediately notify the Superintendent of any lot that does not meet the specified requirements and any subsequent lot shall be tested as if it were the initial lot. If any lot meets the specified requirements but is reworked to comply with the specified compaction requirements, it shall be retested for compliance with specified requirements.

If the Contractor is testing at the minimum frequency and any test lot does not meet specification requirements, the Superintendent may require the testing of the post-compaction grading and PI of all lots constructed after the last tested lot. This testing shall be carried out at no additional cost to VicRoads.

(ii) Scale B Requirements for Post Compaction Grading and PI Testing

Where testing is specified in Clause 304.10(c) or (d) and Clause 304.12 requires it to be Scale B, the first lot of each pavement course shall be tested for post-compaction grading and PI.

If the first lot each pavement course satisfies the specified post compaction requirements in Clause 304.10(a) and (b), as applicable, no further post-compaction testing will be required for that pavement course.

**If the first lot does not meet the requirements specified in Clause 304.10(a) and (b), the Contractor shall then seek approval from the Superintendent before work proceeds.**

(iii) Scale C Requirements for Post Compaction Grading and PI Testing

Post compaction grading and PI testing is not required.

##### (c) Maximum Allowable Working Time

The type of cementitious binder added shall be selected on the basis of the maximum allowable working times specified in Table 307.052 and the minimum working time considered necessary to properly mix the material, trim and shape the surface to level and fully compact the layer to the specified density ratio.

**HP If the Contractor proposes to use an alternative cementitous binder to those included in Table 307.052, laboratory test results shall be produced to the Superintendent showing that the maximum allowable working time for the cementitious binder as determined in accordance with the VicRoads Test Method satisfies the required working time and the cement stabilised material using the alternative binder meets specified strength requirements.**

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

\* The Superintendent may agree to a cementitious binder content of less than 1.5% but at least 1% by mass if the UCS requirement at a binder content of 1.5% is more than 50% above the target UCS. If less than 1.5% by mass of cementitious binder is permitted, a minimum of two mixing runs shall be undertaken after spreading of cementitious binder and the minimum density ratio specified in Clause 307.13 shall be increased by one percentage point.

### 307.06 COMMENCEMENT OF WORK

**HP**** The Contractor shall not commence work until all mix design details have been presented to the Superintendent showing compliance with the requirements of Clause 307.05 and approval has been given for stabilisation work to proceed.**


### 307.07 CONSTRUCTION PLANT

The Contractor shall provide construction plant meeting the following requirements and capability.

##### (a) Spreader for Cementitious Binder

Mechanical equipment specifically designed for the spreading of cementitious binder directly on to the prepared roadbed shall be used. The spreader shall be capable of accurately regulating the discharge of the cementitious binder such that the requirements of Clause 307.14 are met.

##### (b) Mixing Machine

A purpose built mixing machine designed for in situ stabilisation of roadworks shall be used to pulverise the existing pavement material and uniformly mix the material together with water and cementitious binder to the specified depth of stabilisation. Rotary hoes and other types of agricultural machinery shall not be used.

After pulverisation and mixing, all base material shall be capable of passing a 37.5 mm sieve and all subbase material shall be capable of passing a 53 mm sieve.

##### (c) Watering Plant

Watering plant or any purpose designed watering system incorporated within the mixing machine shall be capable of uniformly distributing sufficient water to hydrate any quicklime used for lime pre-treatment and if required, add more water to increase the moisture content to aid compaction.

##### (d) Compaction Plant

Compaction plant shall be of such mass as to be capable of compacting the stabilised layer to the minimum density ratio throughout the depth of the layer.

Where compaction is to be accepted on a procedural basis rather than by lot testing, the Superintendent and the Contractor shall agree on the number and minimum mass of rollers and the compaction routine to be used. If the compacted depth of layer exceeds 150 mm, the following items of compaction plant shall be used as a minimum requirement:

• a vibrating pad foot roller for initial compaction;

• a vibrating steel flat roller for densification;

• a multi wheel roller for finishing and sealing off the surface prior to trafficking.

### 307.08 CONSTRUCTION

##### (a) General

Construction includes the pulverisation of any seal or asphalt surfacing, premixing of in situ materials, supply and spreading of any additional granular material, supply, spreading and mixing of cementitious binder into the in situ pavement material, and compaction, trimming and curing of the stabilised layer.

Unless otherwise specified, stabilisation work undertaken each day shall be completed across the full pavement width.

Stabilisation operations may continue during light rainfall if the moisture content of the in situ pavement material can be maintained below modified optimum moisture content.

Only sufficient area of pavement is to be pulverised that can be mixed and fully compacted in one day. For stabilised patching work which is to be trafficked or sealed immediately after completion of compaction, only sufficient pavement area shall be opened up to enable work to be completed within the maximum allowable working time specified in Table 307.052.

##### (b) Preparation of the Existing Pavement

The existing pavement shall be pulverised and mixed to the proposed depth of stabilisation prior to spreading of the cementitious binder. If significantly different in situ materials are present across the width of pavement to be stabilised, the Contractor shall use a system for cross blending materials as necessary, to produce a uniform material prior to addition of cementitious binder.


In locations where a pavement has been pre-treated with lime to dry the material out or lower the Plasticity Index, addition of further cementitious binder and remixing shall not commence until the following day.

The Contractor shall remove or re‑pulverise lumps of asphalt or seal which would otherwise be retained on a 53 mm sieve. The volume any large size material removed from the site shall be replaced with an equivalent volume of suitable granular pavement material.

##### (c) Lime Pre-treatment

If the material to be stabilised is to be first pre-treated with lime to lower its plasticity, lime shall be spread uniformly over the prepared surface at the Lime Spreading Rate calculated using formula (i) or (ii) below.

(i) Where hydrated lime has been used in the laboratory testing to determine the Design Distribution Rate of Available Lime and it is proposed to use quicklime at the job site, the Lime Spreading Rate shall be determined from:

| Lime Spreading Rate = 0.76 X | Design Distribution Rate of Available Lime |
| --- | --- |
| ALI of Lime to be Used (%) |

(ii) Where the same type of lime (hydrated lime or quicklime) is to be used at the job site as has been used in the laboratory tests to determine the Design Distribution Rate of Available Lime, the Lime Spreading Rate shall be determined from:

| Lime Spreading Rate = | Design Distribution Rate of Available Lime |
| --- | --- |
| ALI of Lime to be Used (%) |

If quicklime is used it shall be slaked with sufficient water to allow full slaking to take place prior to mixing. Full slaking will be deemed to have been achieved when all quicklime that has been spread has changed from a cream coloured granulate to a fine white powder and there is a cessation of rising vapours.

Mixing of quicklime into the pavement material shall not commence until full slaking has been achieved.

##### (d) Spreading of Lime or Cementitious Binder

Spreading shall not be carried out at times when lime or cementitious binder could become air borne or dispersed in such a way as to become a nuisance or a hazard to persons, property or livestock.

Immediately following completion of spreading, the Contractor shall check and record the Average Spreading Rates and the Uniformity of Spread in accordance with Clause 307.15. If the required Spreading Rate for lime or cementitious binder exceeds 15 kg/m2, it shall be spread in two equal spreading runs with material from the first spread run being fully mixed into the pavement material prior to the second spreading run being undertaken.

The prepared pavement shall not be trafficked until the cementitious binder has been mixed into the pavement material.

##### (e) Mixing in Cementitious Binder

Mixing shall commence as soon as practical after spreading of the cementitious binder and shall continue until all pavement materials and cementitious binder are uniformly blended throughout the full depth of the stabilised layer.

The moisture content of the pavement material prior to addition of the cementitious binder shall be within the range 80% to 100% of the Modified optimum moisture content. Additional water shall be added to hydrate the cementitious binder.

For modified or deep-lift stabilisation, a minimum of two mixing runs shall be carried out. For deep-lift stabilisation, approximately half of the cementitious binder shall be spread in advance of each run. Unless otherwise specified, the depth of stabilisation or compacted layer thickness for stabilisation shall not exceed 350 mm.


##### (f) Compaction

Compaction of the stabilised layer shall commence immediately after mixing. Compaction equipment shall work as close as practicable behind the mixer to maximise the time available for compaction. Compaction and trimming shall be carried out in a continuous operation.

All compaction shall be completed within the times specified in Table 307.052 after addition of the cementitious binder.

Where necessary during compaction, the Contractor shall water the material to maintain the moisture content within 80% to 100% Modified optimum moisture content.

##### (g) Trimming

On completion of initial rolling, the stabilised material shall be trimmed to the specified surface tolerances. Light applications of water may be applied during this operation to replace evaporated moisture and to assist in rapid achievement of a tightly knit surface.

All surface irregularities which do not conform to the requirements of Clause 307.03 shall be rectified by the Contractor within the maximum working time for the cementitious binder used as specified in Table 307.052. Rectification beyond the maximum working time for the cementitious binder shall be carried out by replacing material with freshly stabilised material as necessary.

The material trimmed off shall be either cut to waste and if necessary, removed from site or, alternatively it may be transported to another location to be incorporated into a stabilised layer.

### 307.09 JOINTING

Longitudinal joints shall be avoided by completing a full carriageway width each day. If a longitudinal joint is required, because of rain or traffic control requirements, it shall be located at a lane line or in the centre of the carriageway. Transverse joints shall be formed where stabilisation operations have been halted for more than the time specified in Table 307.052 and at the end of each day's work.

Joints shall be formed by cutting back into the fully compacted previously stabilised material by a minimum of 300 mm which shall be remixed into the new work. Additional stabilising agent shall be added to the area of previously stabilised material to be remixed. Placement of additional cementitious binder shall be deemed to be part of the joint construction.

The level and shape of the surface at all joints shall be within the limits specified in Clause 307.03.

### 307.10 TEST ROLLING

Stabilised layers shall pass test rolling in accordance with Section 173, prior to acceptance of the layer.

Any unstable areas detected by test rolling shall be rectified.

### 307.11 MAINTENANCE OF THE STABILISED SURFACE PRIOR TO SURFACING OR OVERLAY

The Contractor shall keep the stabilised pavement surface moist and protected from damage by traffic or construction activities until either a further pavement layer or the bituminous surfacing is applied.

### 307.12 PRELIMINARY TRIAL

If directed by the Superintendent, the Contractor shall carry out a preliminary trial of the proposed stabilising operation.

The trial shall determine:

(a) the effectiveness of the construction plant;

(b) the number of passes of the stabilisation machine necessary to achieve uniform pulverisation and mixing;

(c) the field moisture content required to achieve specified compaction requirements;

(d) the rolling routine required to meet specified compaction requirements.


The trialsection shall be located within the Works area.

The lengthof the trial section shall be between 100 and 200 metres over the full width of the area proposed for stabilisation.

**HP**** Stabilisation work shall not proceed outside the trial section until the Superintendent has reviewed all aspects of the stabilising operation. The Superintendent's review of the stabilising plant and procedures will be provided to the Contractor by the end of the next working week day after the trial's completion. If the Specification requirements are not met for this trial section, the Superintendent may direct that another trial section be stabilised or the rejected section be re‑stabilised and presented for re‑assessment.**

### 307.13 REQUIREMENTS FOR TESTING AND ACCEPTANCE OF COMPACTION AND STRENGTH

##### (a) General

(i) Lot Testing Requirements

Where a Scale A1, A2 or Scale B compaction standard is specified in Table 307.161, compaction is to be accepted by density testing in lots of similar material and work. Unless otherwise specified, the maximum lot size shall be the area of work completed on the same day up to 4,000 m2 provided that the whole of the lot is essentially a uniform material similar to material used for the relevant mix design applicable to the lot. If the maximum binder working time requires the area or work to be completed in one day to split into sub-sections, each sub-section shall be treated as a separate lot.

If the material is too variable to be able to assign a single maximum dry density for the lot, a separate reference density shall be determined for each test site.

If a compaction Scale is not specified in Table 307.161, the Scale C compaction procedure shall be adopted.

The calculation of density ratio shall be based on Modified compactive effort of the laboratory prepared sample containing the design rate of cementitious binder.

The work shall be assessed for compliance with Scale A1 or A2, Scale B or Scale C requirements for testing and acceptance of compaction as specified in Clauses 307.13(b), (c) and (d) and Clause 307.16.

(ii) Determination of the Density Ratio

If it is not possible to transport extracted samples of mixed material to an established laboratory for determination of the reference density within the maximum working time of the cementitious binder, and the Superintendent agrees that establishment of a site laboratory for this purpose is not warranted, the following procedure shall be used to determine the Density Ratio:

1. measure field density on completion of compaction;

2. extract samples and transport to an offsite laboratory;

3. determine the reference density for the laboratory compacted samples as soon as practicable but not exceeding 24 hours;

4. determine the Density Ratio (DR) from -

**DR = DR**** t **** x DDCF**

Where:

DRt = Density Ratio calculated using the reference density determined at time (t)

DDCF = Density Decay Correction Factor determined from Table 307.131 corresponding to time (t), the binder type and the time of year construction is being undertaken.


**Table 307.131 Density Decay Correction Factors**

| **Time (t) from Addition of Binder to Completion of Laboratory Compaction****(hours) **|** Cementitious Binder****(construction between October and April)** | **Cementitious Binder**** (construction between May and September)** |

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 18 to 24 | 0.987 | 0.973 | 0.951 | 0.990 | 0.977 | 0.958 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

For individual jobs more than 10000 m2 where the material to be stabilised is of a similar nature throughout, the Contractor shall determine and apply a job specific DDCF determined in accordance with the relevant Test Method specified in VicRoads Code of Practice 500.16.

##### (b) Scale A1 and A2 Requirements for Testing and Acceptance of Compaction

(i) Scale A1assessment shall be used where the in situ material is sufficiently consistent to be assigned a Maximum Dry Density for the lot.

If a single maximum dry density can be assigned to the lot the work represented by the lot will be accepted as far as compaction is concerned if the characteristic value of density ratio obtained from six randomly selected test sites within the lot is not less than 95.0%.

If the characteristic value of density ratio of the lot is less than 95.0%, but greater than or equal to 90.0% the work represented by the lot may be accepted as far as compaction is concerned but payment for the whole of such work will be made at a rate calculated using the formula:

**P = 6R**** c **** - 470**

where Rc is the characteristic value of density ratio of the lot and P is the rate of payment expressed as a percentage of the value of work represented by the lot provided that the value of P shall not exceed 100. For the application of this formula, the value of the work represented by the lot shall be calculated using the unit rate specified in Clause 307.16(b).

(ii) Scale A2 assessment shall be used where in situ material is too variable to assign a Maximum Dry Density to the lot.

If the material is too variable to assign a single maximum dry density to the lot and requires separate maximum dry densities to be determined for each test site, the work represented by the lot will be accepted, as far as compaction is concerned, if the mean value of the density ratio obtained from three randomly selected test sites within the lot is not less than 97% with no individual value being less than 90%.


If the mean value of density ratio of the lot is less than 97%, but greater than or equal to 92%, the work represented by the lot may be accepted but payment for the whole of such work will be made at a rate calculated using the formula:

**P = 6Rm - 482**

where Rm is the mean value of density ratio of the lot and P is the rate of payment expressed as a percentage of the value of work represented by the lot provided that the value of P shall not exceed 100. For the application of this formula, the value of the work represented by the lot shall be calculated using the unit rate specified in Clause 307.16(b).

Work which has a mean value of density ratio of less than 92% shall be rejected and the Contractor shall submit a proposal to rectify the work to the Superintendent for approval.

##### (c) Scale B Requirements for Testing and Acceptance of Compaction

The work represented by the lot will be accepted as far as compaction is concerned if the mean of the individual density ratio test values from three randomly selected test sites for the lot is not less than 95.0%.

If the mean of the individual density ratio test values for the lot is less than 95.0% but greater than or equal to 90.0%, the work represented by the lot may be accepted as far as compaction is concerned but payment for the whole of such work will be made at a rate calculated using the formula:

**P = 6R**** m **** - 470**

where Rm is the mean of the individual density ratio test values for the lot and P is the rate of payment expressed as a percentage of the value of work represented by the lot provided that the value of P shall not exceed 100. For the application of this formula, the value of the work represented by the lot shall be calculated using the unit rate specified in Clause 307.16(b).

##### (d) Scale C Requirements for Acceptance of Compaction

The Superintendent may direct the Contractor to construct a trial section of stabilised pavement as specified in Clause 307.10.

Acceptance of work will be based upon on compaction plant to be used, compaction routine and a density monitoring procedure using a nuclear gauge and proof rolling as specified or agreed between the Superintendent and the Contractor.

Any unstable areas within limits of work and depth of stabilisation detected by test rolling shall be rectified by the Contractor and re‑presented for test rolling.

##### (e) Assessment of Compaction for Thick Layers

For compacted layers in excess of 200 mm thick, the Contractor shall measure the field density of the layer in two sub-layers of equal thickness in accordance with the relevant Test Method. At each test site the sub-layer with the lower of the two density test results shall be used in the calculation of the Characteristic or Mean Density Ratio for assessment of compaction in accordance with Clause 307.13.

### 307.14 REQUIREMENTS FOR TESTING AND ACCEPTANCE OF SPREADING RATES

##### (a) Mat or Tray System

The average spreading rate of lime or cementitious binder shall be ascertained by dividing the mass of cementitious binder spreading by the area over which the cementitious binder has been spread. Where the average spreading rate is less than the specified or design spread rate, additional cementitious binder shall be spread to bring the average rate up to at least the design spread rate.

The Contractor shall check the uniformity of spreading rate of lime or cementitious binder at the frequency specified in Clause 307.15 by placing a minimum of three mats or trays with a plan area not less than 1 m2 in the path of the spreading vehicle at an equal spacing of not less than 25% of the length of the spreading run. The spreading rate over each mat or tray shall be calculated by dividing the mass of lime or cementitious binder deposited on each mat or tray by the plan area of the mat or tray. Where the spread rate so determined for any mat or tray is less than the specified rate by more than 10%, additional cementitious binder shall be spread over the part or all of the area over which the lime or cementitious binder has been spread.


##### (b) Continuous Weighing System

The mass of lime or cementitious binder spread over the pavement surface may be measured and recorded by a spreader fitted with a fully calibrated electronic weigh scale system capable of continuously measuring and recording the mass of lime or cementitious binder at intervals of not more than 100 m of forward travel. The Contractor shall have a current certificate of calibration for the computerised spreading equipment and shall produce evidence of the actual running spread rate when requested by the Superintendent.

### 307.15 MINIMUM TESTING FREQUENCY

The Contractor shall test the materials and the stabilised pavement layer at a frequency which is sufficient to ensure that the materials and work under the Contract comply with the specified requirements but not less than the frequency specified in Table 307.151.

**Table 307.151**

| **Test** | **Minimum Frequency of Testing** |
| --- | --- |
| Available Lime / Available Lime Index | One test per production day at the point of manufacture. |
| Uniformity of Spreading Rate of Lime or Cementitious Binder | A mat or tray test (minimum of 3 mats or trays as specified in Clause 307.14(a)) for each separate continuous spreading run except where calibrated load cell computerised spreading devices are fitted with a system to continuously monitor the spread rate every 100 m. |
| Average Spread Rate of Lime or Cementitious Binder | Each continuous spreader run. Based on the total tonnage used for the run (kg) divided by the area covered (m²). |
| Uniformity of Mixing | For each compaction lot – Visual inspection of six random test holes excavated for the full depth of the loose material after mixing of the binder and prior to commencement of compaction. |
| Characteristic or Mean Density Ratio | Every lot as defined in Clause 307.13(a). |

The amount of Calcium Oxide (CaO) or Calcium Hydroxide (Ca(OH)2) contained in Quicklime or Hydrated Lime respectively.

**Available Lime Index (ALI)**

The Calcium Oxide or Calcium Hydroxide content of quicklime or hydrated lime respectively, expressed as a percentage of the total mass of lime determined in accordance with AS 4489.6.1.

**Expansion Ratio**

The expansion ratio is the ratio of the maximum volume of the bitumen in its foamed state to the final volume of bitumen once the foaming has subsided.

**Foamed Bitumen**

Foamed bitumen is a mixture of air, water and hot bitumen. When hot bitumen comes in contact with cold water the mixture expands to greater than ten times its original bitumen volume forming a fine mist or foam.

**Half-life**

Half-life is the time taken (measured in seconds) for the maximum volume of foamed bitumen to dissipate to half of the maximum expansion volume.

**Hydrated Lime**

Hydrated lime is a powdered form of lime consisting primarily of calcium hydroxide, also referred to as slaked lime.

**Quicklime**

Quicklime is a fine granulated powder consisting primarily of Calcium Oxide that can be readily slaked by the application of water after it has been evenly spread to form Calcium Hydroxide.

**Initial Working Time**

The time required to mix, fully compact and trim the stabilised pavement layer after the addition of foamed bituminous binder.

**Reference Density**

The reference density is the maximum dry density or the peak converted wet density determined in accordance with the appropriate test method, but adjusted for oversize material as appropriate.


**Supplementary Binder**

Foamed bitumen stabilisation may incorporate a supplementary binder comprising either hydrated lime or quicklime.

**Target Depth**

The target depth is the cutting depth required by the reclaimer/stabiliser to achieve the lower reference level (LRL). To achieve the LRL, the cutting depth (target depth) should take into account the bulk height. Refer to Figure 1 Diagramatic Representation of Foam Bitumen Stabilisation's key terms. In establishing the target depth the following should be noted.

(a) Pulverisation/secondary additive incorporation

Preliminary pulverisation and incorporation of supplementary binder is mixing to 50 mm less than the design depth.

(b) Bulking after secondary additive incorporation

After surface compaction and trimming, the volume of materials change due to incorporation of the supplementary binder. The bulking height above the finished surface level (FSL) needs to be identified and added to the design depth.

(c) Target depth/final foam bitumen stabilisation pass

The cutting depth required on the final pass by the reclaimer/stabiliser to reach the LRL will need to account for the additional bulking above the FSL.

Field density shall be measured at the completion of compaction of the foamed bitumen stabilised pavement. Material shall be sampled from the site to enable three samples to be prepared in the laboratory, for determination of the reference density, before three hours have elapsed after foam bitumen stabilisation. The Density Ratio shall be determined in accordance with Section 173.

##### (b) Scale A Requirements for Testing and Acceptance of Compaction

If a single maximum dry density can be assigned to the lot the work represented by the lot will be accepted as far as compaction is concerned if the characteristic value of density ratio obtained from six randomly selected test sites within the lot is not less than 98%.

If the characteristic value of density ratio of the lot is less than 98%, but greater than or equal to 93% the work represented by the lot may be accepted as far as compaction is concerned but payment for the whole of such work will be made at a rate calculated using the formula:

**P = 6R**** c **** - 488**

in which Rc is the characteristic value of density ratio of the lot and P is the rate of payment expressed as a percentage of the value of work represented by the lot provided that the value of P shall not exceed 100. For the application of this formula, the value of the work represented by the lot shall be calculated using the unit rate specified in Clause 308.16(b).

Work which has a mean value of density ratio of less than 93% shall be rejected and the Contractor shall submit a proposal to rectify the work to the Superintendent for approval.

##### (c) Scale B Requirements for Testing and Acceptance of Compaction

The work represented by the lot will be accepted as far as compaction is concerned if the mean of the individual density ratio test values from three randomly selected test sites for the lot is not less than 100%.

If the mean of the individual density ratio test values for the lot is less than 100% but greater than or equal to 95%, the work represented by the lot may be accepted as far as compaction is concerned but payment for the whole of such work will be made at a rate calculated using the formula:

**P = 6R**** m **** - 500**

where Rm is the mean of the individual density ratio test values for the lot and P is the rate of payment expressed as a percentage of the value of work represented by the lot provided that the value of P shall not exceed 100. For the application of this formula, the value of the work represented by the lot shall be calculated using the unit rate specified in Clause 308.16(b).

##### (d) Scale C Requirements for Acceptance of Compaction

The Superintendent may direct the Contractor to construct a trial section of stabilised pavement as specified in Clause 308.12.

Acceptance of work will be based on compaction plant to be used, compaction routine and a density monitoring procedure using a nuclear gauge and proof rolling as specified or approved by the Superintendent.

Any unstable areas within limits of work and depth of stabilisation detected by test rolling shall be rectified by the Contractor and re‑presented for test rolling.

Lots where the binder is spread at an average rate less than 95% design spread rate will be rejected.

The Contractor shall check the uniformity of the spreading of the supplementary binder at the frequency specified in Clause 308.15 by placing mats or trays with a plan area not less than 1 m2 in the path of the spreading vehicle and dividing the mass of the supplementary binder deposited on each mat by the plan area of the mat or tray. Where the spread rate so determined for any mat or tray is less than the specified rate by more than 10%, additional supplementary binder shall be spread over the part or all of the area over which the binder has been spread.

##### (b) Continuous Weighing System

The mass of the supplementary binder spread over the pavement surface may be measured and recorded by a spreader fitted with a fully calibrated electronic weigh scale system capable of continuously measuring and recording the mass of the supplementary binder at intervals of not more than 100 m of forward travel. The recorded measurements of spread rate shall be made available to the Superintendent on request.

##### (c) Bituminous Binder Application

The binder shall be uniformly incorporated by a controlled device that provides calibration to the application rate in litres/m2 of residual bitumen.

## SECTION 310 ‑ PREPARATION OF GRANULAR PAVEMENTS FOR BITUMINOUS SURFACING

##This section cross-references Section 175.

If Section 175 is relevant, it should be included in the specification.

If Section 175 is not included in the specification, all references to it should be struck out, ensuring that the remaining text is still coherent. DELETE THIS NOTE FROM FINAL DOCUMENT:

### 310.01 DESCRIPTION

This section covers the requirements for preparation of unbound granular pavements, including in situ cementitious and bituminous stabilised pavements, for sprayed bituminous surfacing or asphalt surfacing.

### 310.02 PAVEMENT PREPARATION

The Contractor shall prepare for bituminous surfacing the lengths, widths and areas specified or shown on the drawings for bituminous surfacing plus an additional 0.3 m on sides where there is no concrete edging. The surface of the shoulders and verges shall be matched to the finished surface of the prepared pavement.

Construction practices that produce a slurry or pasting of fine material at the surface are not permitted.

The addition of fine material to the surface is not permitted.

Where the Superintendent considers the prepared surface to have excessive fines, the pavement layer shall be rectified to a condition acceptable to the Superintendent.

The pavement shall be prepared to produce a surface that is:

(a) constructed to meet specified shape and level requirements

(b) homogenous and consistent with the material in the pavement base layer

(c) uniform in texture

(d) free of tearing and scabbing

(e) free of lamination on or within 75 mm of the finished surface

(f) level with adjacent sealed areas and edgings at the joints

(g) a hard dense and tight surface capable of being swept with a rotary road broom or similar

(h) free of loose and foreign materials

(i) dried back to the moisture content and embedment requirements specified in Clause 310.03.

Any imperfections as listed above shall be corrected in a manner acceptable to the Superintendent. Where this involves the re-working of the material, the full layer depth shall be re-worked.

The total area of the work shall be presented to the Superintendent for acceptance for surfacing as one lot.

### 310.03 DRYING BACK OF PAVEMENT BASE PRIOR TO BITUMINOUS SURFACING

##### (a) Pavement Dryback

The uppermost pavement layer after preparation of the surface and prior to priming or primersealing shall be allowed to dry back so the moisture content of the layer meets the requirements of Table 310.031 for each test lot.

The mean Moisture Ratio shall be determined from six randomly selected sites as a percentage of the optimum moisture content based on Modified compactive effort, and determined in accordance with VicRoads Test Method RC 316.14 - _Moisture Ratio Determination for Assessment of Dry-Back of Granular Pavement Materials_, as listed in Section 175.


##### (b) Pavement Embedment

Pavement embedment shall be assessed by Ball Penetration testing when required as detailed in Table 310.031. Ball Penetration testing shall be undertaken on the prepared surface in accordance with Austroads test method AG:PT/T251 - Ball Penetration Test at six randomly selected sites. No individual test result shall exceed the maximum penetration detailed in Table 310.031.

**Table 310.031 Requirements for Pavement Dryback and Embedment**

| **Testing Scale** | **Pavement Dryback** | **Pavement Embedment** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Mean Moisture Ratio** | **Maximum of any individual result** | **Ball Penetration**** Maximum individual result** |
| A | Less than 60% | 70% | 3 mm |
| B | Less than 60% | 70% | Not required |
| Less than 65% | 70% | 3 mm |
| C | Less than 65% | 70% | Not required |

##### (c) Testing Schedule

The Contractor shall carry out testing for pavement dryback and embedment in accordance with Table 310.032.

The maximum lot size to be presented for testing under this provision shall be 4000 m², and testing shall be undertaken no more than 24 hours before priming or primersealing. Test sites for assessing conformance with Table 310.031 shall be selected in accordance with VicRoads Test Method RC316.10 – _Selection of Test Sites_ as listed in Section 175. Where both dryback and embedment testing are required, both tests shall be undertaken at the same test site within the same square metre.

Where the pavement moisture content has increased during the period between dryback testing and the proposed time of bituminous surfacing, the Superintendent may require pavement dryback and embedment to be reassessed in accordance with this clause.

### 310.04 MAINTENANCE PRIOR TO BITUMINOUS SURFACING

Following the acceptance of the prepared surface and until bituminous surfacing is completed, the Contractor shall maintain the pavement in the accepted condition until surfacing works are completed. Should the pavement condition deteriorate before surfacing works are completed, the Contractor shall re‑prepare the pavement and re‑present the pavement for acceptance.
